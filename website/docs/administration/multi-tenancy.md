# Choose an isolation boundary

WSO2 FHIR Server supports two deployment patterns. Choose the isolation boundary before provisioning data or exposing client URLs.

## Dedicated server and database

Run one server and one PostgreSQL database for each tenant.

**Use this model when:**

- Regulatory or contractual requirements demand physical separation.
- Tenants need independent scaling, maintenance, backup, or retention policies.
- Operational simplicity is more important than infrastructure consolidation.

The FHIR base URL does not require a tenant path:

```text
https://tenant.example.com/fhir/r4
```

## Shared server and database

Run one service and database while scoping data with a tenant identifier and PostgreSQL row-level security.

No configuration flag is needed: the server always mounts both the bare FHIR base path and the tenant-prefixed routes, and the row-level security policies are part of the standard schema. Requests to the bare path use the default tenant scope; requests under a tenant prefix are scoped to that tenant.

:::danger The database role must NOT be a superuser
PostgreSQL superusers — and any role with `BYPASSRLS` — ignore Row-Level Security, which
silently disables tenant isolation. Create a dedicated least-privilege role for the server and
connect as it:

```sql
CREATE ROLE fhir_app LOGIN PASSWORD '…';            -- NOT a superuser
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO fhir_app;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO fhir_app;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO fhir_app;
```

Run migrations as the owner/admin role; run the server as `fhir_app`. Single-tenant deployments
that never use the tenant routes are unaffected either way.
:::

Tenant-aware routes use:

```text
/t/{tenant}/fhir/r4
```

Set `BASE_URL` to the bare FHIR base URL, without a tenant prefix. The server inserts `/t/{tenant}` into generated links (search Bundles, `Location` headers, the CapabilityStatement) automatically for tenant-prefixed requests.

## Enable and use a tenant

There is nothing to enable and no tenant to register. Every FHIR route is already mounted under
`/t/{tenant}`, and a tenant begins to exist the first time you write to its path. The walkthrough
below uses two tenants, `acme` and `beta`, on a stock deployment.

**1. Write into a tenant.** Use the tenant path instead of the bare base path:

```bash title="Request"
curl -i -X POST "http://localhost:9090/t/acme/fhir/r4/Patient" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
  -d '{"resourceType": "Patient", "name": [{"family": "Acme-Patient"}]}'
```

The `Location` header comes back tenant-scoped, so a client can follow it without knowing the
tenancy rules:

```text title="Response headers"
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
ETag: W/"1"
Location: http://localhost:9090/t/acme/fhir/r4/Patient/ef8e696f-cb28-4a2d-859a-8ffbc8868249/_history/1
```

**2. Read it back inside the same tenant.**

```bash title="Request"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  "http://localhost:9090/t/acme/fhir/r4/Patient/ef8e696f-cb28-4a2d-859a-8ffbc8868249"
```

```text title="Response"
200
```

**3. Confirm the boundary holds.** The same id is not readable from another tenant, nor from the
default scope — the row-level security policy filters it out, so the server answers `404` rather
than revealing that the id exists elsewhere:

```bash title="Request"
# same resource id, different scopes
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "beta:    %{http_code}\n" \
  "http://localhost:9090/t/beta/fhir/r4/Patient/ef8e696f-cb28-4a2d-859a-8ffbc8868249"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "default: %{http_code}\n" \
  "http://localhost:9090/fhir/r4/Patient/ef8e696f-cb28-4a2d-859a-8ffbc8868249"
```

```text title="Response"
beta:    404
default: 404
```

Searches are scoped the same way:

```bash title="Request"
for scope in "/t/acme" "/t/beta" ""; do
  printf "%-8s " "${scope:-default}"
  curl -sS "http://localhost:9090${scope}/fhir/r4/Patient?_total=accurate" | jq '.total'
done
```

```text title="Response"
/t/acme  2
/t/beta  0
default  0
```

**4. Check the generated links.** Bundle navigation links stay inside the tenant, so paging a
tenant-scoped search never escapes its scope:

```bash title="Request"
curl -sS "http://localhost:9090/t/acme/fhir/r4/Patient?_count=1" | jq '[.link[].url]'
```

```json title="Response"
[
  "http://localhost:9090/t/acme/fhir/r4/Patient?_count=1&_page=1",
  "http://localhost:9090/t/acme/fhir/r4/Patient?_count=1&_page=1",
  "http://localhost:9090/t/acme/fhir/r4/Patient?_count=1&_page=2"
]
```

The tenant's [CapabilityStatement](../api/capability-statement.md) is served the same way, at
`/t/acme/fhir/r4/metadata`.

:::note
Requests to the bare base path are not rejected — they run in the **default** tenant scope. Treat
that scope as one more tenant: on a shared deployment, either route all traffic through a tenant
prefix at the gateway, or accept that the bare path is its own isolated dataset.
:::

:::warning
A URL tenant identifier is routing context, not proof of identity or authorization. Place an authenticated gateway or equivalent security layer in front of the service and bind the authenticated tenant to the routed tenant value.
:::

## Tenant-scoped reindexing

Start and poll [`$reindex` jobs](../api/operations.md#reindex) through the same tenant prefix:

```text
POST /t/acme/fhir/r4/$reindex
GET /t/acme/fhir/r4/_operations/reindex/{jobId}
```

A job rebuilds indexes only for the selected tenant, optionally restricted to one resource type.
The server accepts one queued or running job per tenant; a job in another tenant can proceed.
Reading a job ID through a different tenant's path returns `404`. The bare base path starts and
reads jobs for the default tenant.

Search-parameter definitions are shared across tenants. After adding or changing a definition,
start a job for each tenant whose existing resources need the new indexes. Reindexing one tenant
does not repair another tenant's indexes.

`reindex_jobs` uses tenant row-level security. Workers discover pending jobs through an internal
queue containing tenant and job identifiers plus scheduling times, then enter that tenant's database scope to rebuild
indexes and update status. Apply the new tables and runtime grants when upgrading; see
[Database provisioning](./deployment.md#database-provisioning).

Bind these routes to authenticated tenants at the gateway as you do for resource requests. The
server does not assign an admin role or authorize a caller to choose a tenant.

## Selection guide

| Concern | Dedicated | Shared |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data isolation | Infrastructure boundary | Database policy boundary |
| Scaling | Per tenant | Shared capacity |
| Upgrades | Independent | Coordinated |
| Backup and restore | Per tenant | Requires tenant-aware procedures |
| Operational overhead | Higher | Lower |

Validate backups, connection pooling, privileged database access, and cross-tenant negative tests for the selected model.
