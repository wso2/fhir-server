# Deployment best practices

The server ships as a Go binary and container image. A production deployment also needs PostgreSQL, schema provisioning, ingress and identity controls, backups, secrets, monitoring, and a deliberate tenant model. The practices below cover each of those.

## Deployment checklist

1. Build an immutable binary or container from a reviewed commit.
2. Provision a supported PostgreSQL version and apply `internal/db/schema.sql` with a controlled DDL role.
3. Create a least-privileged runtime database role.
4. Store database credentials and other secrets outside the image and repository.
5. Set `BASE_URL` to the canonical externally reachable FHIR base URL.
6. Configure read, write, idle, client, ingress, and database timeouts coherently.
7. Put TLS and authenticated authorization enforcement in front of the service.
8. Configure liveness (`/health/live`) and readiness (`/health/ready`) probes separately.
9. Establish backup, restore, retention, and disaster-recovery procedures.
10. For multi-replica deployments, set `SEARCH_PARAM_WATCH=true` so search-parameter changes reach every replica.
11. Run smoke, search, tenancy, and restore tests before accepting traffic.

## Container

Tag images with a reviewed commit or release version rather than a mutable tag, and deploy by immutable digest:

```bash
docker build -t "fhir-server:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" .
```

Pass runtime configuration through environment variables or mount a YAML configuration file. Do not bake credentials into the image.

## Database provisioning

Apply the schema separately:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f internal/db/schema.sql
```

`FHIR_CREATE_TABLES` remains off by default. `FHIR_CREATE_TABLES=true` is intended for controlled
first-start or local workflows, not as a default runtime privilege.

When upgrading to a version with `$reindex`, reapply `internal/db/schema.sql` with the schema owner
before starting the new runtime. It adds `reindex_jobs` and `reindex_queue` without rewriting
resource data. Grant the runtime role access to the new tables; earlier
`GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES` commands do not cover tables created afterward:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE reindex_jobs, reindex_queue TO fhir_app;
```

## Network and identity boundary

The FHIR server handles FHIR resources and tenant-scoped storage. Deploy an API gateway, service mesh, or equivalent enforcement point for:

- TLS termination and certificate policy.
- Authentication and token validation.
- Tenant binding and authorization.
- Rate limits and abuse controls.
- Network allowlists and request-size controls.
- Security audit integration.

## Timeouts

`SERVER_WRITE_TIMEOUT` is a deadline on the HTTP connection, not on the work: when it expires,
Go closes the connection but does **not** cancel the handler or its request context — the
handler runs to completion, so a transaction Bundle may still commit after the client has seen a
bare `EOF` (not a `504`). Large transaction Bundles can exceed the default. Measure the largest
supported request under expected concurrency, then coordinate the server, proxy, client, and
database timeout budgets — and keep the server timeout above the client's, so the client governs
abandonment.

:::warning
A client-side `EOF` during a long transaction Bundle is an **indeterminate** outcome: the
database result is independent of the HTTP result, so the transaction may have committed after
the connection closed. Reconcile resource state before retrying — an unconditional retry may
apply the bundle twice.
:::

## Multiple replicas

Search-parameter definitions live in each process. Enable `SEARCH_PARAM_WATCH` (off by default) when
running more than one replica: the replicas then keep those definitions in sync over PostgreSQL
`LISTEN/NOTIFY`, so a `SearchParameter` created on one replica reaches the others and keeps their
write-time search indexing consistent. A single-node deployment needs no setting change.

Propagation is best-effort and eventual — a replica learns of a change when it receives the
notification or reconnects, with no fixed lag bound — but it does not backfill resources already
written without the new parameter. See
[Custom search parameters](../api/search.md#custom-search-parameters).

## Reindex jobs

Start a [`$reindex` job](../api/operations.md#reindex) for each affected tenant after changing custom
or IG search parameters. Jobs do not start on definition changes. Choose an optional resource type
to restrict the pass and a batch size from 1 to 1000 resources (default 100).

Each replica runs one worker, and PostgreSQL locks coordinate work across replicas. A worker
commits each batch's index replacement and progress together. Jobs resume from the last committed
batch after a restart, including when another replica takes over. The server accepts one unfinished
job per tenant.

Requests remain available during a pass. Writes to resources in the current batch can wait for
its locks; affected searches can return incomplete results until completion. Larger batches hold
locks longer and use more memory. The worker also holds a lock on search definitions during a
batch, so configuration writes can wait for the batch to finish.

Before starting a job, let the write replicas converge through `SEARCH_PARAM_WATCH=true` or
restart replicas with stale definitions. The reindex worker reads current definitions from
PostgreSQL, but a later resource write on a stale replica can omit new indexes. If definitions
change after a job starts, the worker fails it; poll the status for its error and start a new job
once the definitions have settled. A failed batch rolls back, while prior committed work remains.

Job status reports committed resource counts without a total or percentage. Include `reindex_jobs`
and `reindex_queue` in database backups alongside resource and index tables so restore preserves
job progress.

## After bulk loading

Run `VACUUM (ANALYZE)` on `resources` and on every search-parameter table after a bulk import, executing each statement outside a transaction. This refreshes visibility maps and planner statistics before serving search traffic. See [Performance tuning](https://github.com/wso2/fhir-server/blob/main/docs/performance-tuning.md) for the full procedure.
